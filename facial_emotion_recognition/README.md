Here is a complete README.md file for your Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) capstone project, including the deployment section you requested:

# Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) – Capstone Project

A real-time facial emotion recognition system using deep learning (CNNs) that classifies six basic human emotions from facial expressions via webcam input.

🎯 **Detected Emotions:**
- 😃 Joy  
- 😢 Sad  
- 😠 Anger  
- 😨 Fear  
- 😲 Surprise  
- 😐 Neutral

## ✅ Features
- Classifies 6 facial emotions in real-time.
- Trained on publicly available FER-2013 dataset.
- Uses Haar Cascades for face detection.
- Built with TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV.
- Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Optional integration with large language models (LLMs) for contextual emotion analysis from text.

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd facial_emotion_recognition
```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv fer_env
source fer_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: fer_env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. (Optional, macOS only) Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## 📦 Dataset Download & Preparation

- Download the FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle:  
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013  
- Place the `fer2013.csv` file inside the `data/` directory.
- Preprocess and filter to six emotions by running:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

## 🧠 Train the Emotion Recognition Model

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

- Trains a CNN with the preprocessed facial images.
- Saves the trained model to `model/emotion_cnn.h5`.

## 🎥 Run Real-time Emotion Detection

Launch the real-time emotion detection app:
```bash
python main.py
```

or directly:
```bash
python src/emotion_detector.py
```

- Uses your webcam to detect faces and predict emotional states.
- Displays live video with facial bounding boxes and emotion labels.

## 🧪 Evaluation

- Emotion classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Evaluations done on validation and test subsets of FER-2013.

## 🤖 Optional: Contextual Emotion Analysis via LLM

Run the text emotion analysis to complement facial recognition:
```bash
python src/llm_integration.py
```

- Uses transformer-based models to predict emotion from text input.
- Can be integrated with the CNN model for richer affective computing applications.

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy this project for real-world usage as follows:

### 1. Desktop Application
- Use frameworks like PyQt5 or Tkinter to create a GUI wrapping your real-time emotion detection.
- Package your app with tools like PyInstaller for distribution.

### 2. Web Application
- Build a Flask or Django web server that:
  - Hosts the CNN model for inference via REST API.
  - Streams video or accepts image uploads for emotion recognition.
- Deploy the web app on cloud platforms such as:
  - Heroku
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - Microsoft Azure App Service
- Use web front-end frameworks (React, Vue) for webcam capture and display.

### 3. Cloud Hosting and Scalability
- Host your trained model and inference code on cloud servers.
- Use containerization with Docker for reproducibility.
- Utilize cloud GPU instances for faster model inference.
- Integrate with serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for cost-effective scaling.

### 4. Mobile Integration (Future)
- Export your model via TensorFlow Lite for mobile devices.
- Embed real-time facial emotion recognition in Android/iOS apps.
- Use mobile device cameras with on-device inference.
